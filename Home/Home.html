      <p>&nbsp;I am Colin Gawel, and i'm a senior at Vinal Technical High School in the Information Technology trade. Through out all four of my years in Vinal, I have learned many usefull skills that will definitley help further my future carrer and ambitious, for example, I have learned all sorts of computing skills, like setting up smart boards, creating my own private domain network,&nbsp; doing helpdesk work for people all around the school, and even some non trade related skillsets, like how to have a professional interview and make and update a resume and cover letter.&nbsp;</p>
      <p>&nbsp;The reason why I chose IT as my shop is because ever since middleschool, I was greatly inspired by my robotics class and all of the cool coding we did in there. Once&nbsp; I found out that Vinal had an IT trade, that decided what high school i wanted to go to.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
